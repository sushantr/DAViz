    "contents" : "Demystifying R Part 2\n========================================================\n\nYou might see a warning message just above this file. Something like...\n\"R Markdown requires the knitr package (version 1.2 or higher)\"\nDon't worry about this for now. We'll address it at the end of this file.\n\n1. Run the following command to see what it does.\n```{r}\nsummary(mtcars)\n```\n\nIf you know about quantiles, then the output should look familiar.\nIf not, you probably recognize the min (minimum), median, mean, and max (maximum).\nWe'll go over quantiles in Lesson 3 so don't worry if the output seems overwhelming.\n\nThe str() and summary() functions are helpful commands when working with a new data set.\nThe str() function gives us the variable names and their types.\nThe summary() function gives us an idea of the values a variable can take on.\n\n2. In 2013, the average mpg (miles per gallon) for a car was 23 mpg.\nThe car models in the mtcars data set come from the year 1973-1974.\nSubset the data so that you create a new data frame that contains\ncars that get 23 or more mpg (miles per gallon). Save it to a new data\nframe called efficient.\n```{r}\nefficient <- subset(mtcars, mpg > 23)\n```\n\n3. How many cars get more than 23 mpg? Use one of the commands you\nlearned in the demystifying.R to answer this question.\n```{r}\nrow.names(efficient)\n```\n\n4. We can also use logical operators to find out which car(s) get greater\nthan 30 miles per gallon (mpg) and have more than 100 raw horsepower.\n```{r}\nsubset(mtcars, mpg > 30 & hp > 100)\n```\n\nThere's only one car that gets more than 30 mpg and 100 hp.\n\n5. What do you think this code does? Scroll down for the answer.\n```{r}\nsubset(mtcars, mpg < 14 | disp > 390)\n```\n\nNote: You may be familiar with the || operator in Java. R uses one single & for the logical\noperator AND. It also uses one | for the logical operator OR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe command above creates a data frame of cars that have mpg less than 14\nOR a displacement of more than 390. Only one of the conditions for a car\nneeds to be satisfied so that the car makes it into the subset. Any of the\ncars that fit the criteria are printed to the console.\n\nNow you try some.\n\n6. Print the cars that have a 1/4 mile time (qsec) less than or equal to\n16.90 seconds to the console.\n```{r}\nsubset(mtcars, qsec <= 16.90)\n```\n\n7. Save the subset of cars that weigh under 2000 pounds (weight is measured in lb/1000)\nto a variable called lightCars. Print the numbers of cars and the subset to the console.\n```{r}\n\n```\n\n8. You can also create new variables in a data frame. Let's say you wanted\nto have the year of each car's model. We can create the variable\nmtcars$year. Here we'll assume that all of the models were from 1974.\nRun the code below.\n```{r}\nmtcars$year <- 1974\n```\n\nNotice how the number of variables changed in the work space. You can\nalso see the result by double clicking on mtcars in the workspace and\nexamining the data in a table.\n\nTo drop a variable, subset the data frame and select the variable you\nwant to drop with a negative sign in front of it.\n```{r}\nmtcars <- subset(mtcars, select = -year)\n```\n\nNotice, we are back to 11 variables in the data frame.\n\n9. What do you think this code does? Run it to find out.\n```{r}\nmtcars$year <- c(1973, 1974)\n```\n\nOpen the table of values to see what values year takes on.\n\nDrop the year variable from the data set.\n```{r}\nmtcars <- subset(mtcars, select = -year)\n```\n\n\n10. Now you are going to get a preview of ifelse(). For those new\nto programming this example may be confusing. See if you can understand\nthe code by running the commands one line at a time. Read the output and\nmake sense of what the code is doing at each step.\n\nIf you are having trouble don't worry, we will review the ifelse statement\nat the end of Lesson 3. You won't be quizzed on it, and it's not essential\nto keep going in this course. We just want you to try to get familiar with\nmore code.\n```{r}\nmtcars$wt\ncond <- mtcars$wt < 3\ncond\nmtcars$weight_class <- ifelse(cond, 'light', 'average')\nmtcars$weight_class\ncond <- mtcars$wt > 3.5\nmtcars$weight_class <- ifelse(cond, 'heavy', mtcars$weight_class)\nmtcars$weight_class\n```\n\nYou have some variables in your workspace or environment like 'cond' and\nefficient. You want to be careful that you don't bring in too much data\ninto R at once since R will hold all the data in working memory. We have\nnothing to worry about here, but let's delete those variables from the\nwork space.\n\n```{r}\nrm(cond)\nrm(efficient)\n```\n\nSave this file if you haven't done so yet.\n\n\nYou'll have the opportunity to create one Rmd file for the final project in\nthis class and submit the Rmd file and knitted output (or HTML file). You'll\nneed the knitr package to do that so let's install that now. **Uncomment** the\nfollowing two lines of code and run them.\n\n```{r}\n# install.packages('knitr', dependencies = T)\n# library(knitr)\n```\n\nOnce you've installed knitr, **comment** out the two lines of code above.\nWhen you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that\nincludes both content (text and text formatting from Markdown) as well as\nthe output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.\n\n\nYou've reached the end of the file so now it's time to write some code to\nanswer a question to continue on in Lesson 2.\n\nWhich car(s) have an mpg (miles per gallon) greater than or equal to 30\nOR hp (horsepower) less than 60? Create an R chunk of code to answer the question.\n\n```{r}\ndata(mtcars)\nstr(mtcars)\nsubset(mtcars, mpg >= 30 | hp < 60)\nmtcars[mtcars$mpg >= 30 | mtcars$hp < 60, ]\n```\n\n\nOnce you have the answer, go the [Udacity website](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud651/l-729069797/e-804129319/m-811719066) to continue with Lesson 2.\n\nNote: You use brackets around text followed by two parentheses to create a link.\nThere must be no spaces between the brackets and the parentheses. Paste or type\nthe link into the parentheses. This also works on the discussions!\n\nAnd if you want to see all of your HARD WORK from this file, click\nthe **KNIT HTML** button now. (You may or may not need to restart R).\n\n# CONGRATULATIONS\n#### You'll be exploring data soon with your new knowledge of R.",
